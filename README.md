# Pundi AI

Pundi AI democratizes artificial intelligence development through a decentralized suite of tools. It offers services ranging from data tagging and annotation to an AI data marketplace.&#x20;

The [Pundi AI Data](readme/pundi-aidata/) platform provides professional data annotation services, ensuring AI data remains open and accessible to all. Powered by the [Pundi AIFX](readme/pundi-aifx/) data layer, Pundi AI securely records activities on-chain and integrates with IPFS and various blockchains, paving the way for a decentralized data exchange. With [PURSE+](readme/purse-docs/) on x.com, users can actively contribute by tagging and annotating data for social AI, fostering a more participatory ecosystem.

This infrastructure ensures AI development remains transparent and resistant to monopolistic control, allowing broader participation and innovation across the industry. Pundi AI's mission is to create an open AI ecosystem where data and development are accessible to everyone.
