# Introduction

The development and demand in the AI field need no further elaboration. As AI models are increasingly trained and applied across various domains, the market demand for computing power and data has reached unprecedented levels. Data, alongside computing power, has become a crucial determinant of a model's success or failure. In fact, given the current limitations in large model architectures, data quality directly determines a model's performance.

To accelerate and propel the AI industry forward, Pundi is leveraging its unique strengths to launch an innovative blockchain-based product: the decentralized AI data platform — Pundi AIFX. By deeply integrating with the AI industry's needs and addressing its challenges, we aim to use blockchain technology to build a bridge between real-world data and AI companies.

> Creating AI is a remarkable achievement, but making AI’s work accessible, widely applicable, and involving common people is even greater.
