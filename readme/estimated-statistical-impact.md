# Estimated Statistical Impact

* Data Quality Improvement: The studies from the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)  show that community-driven annotation can increase data accuracy by up to 30% compared to automated methods.
* Cost Reduction:  Research papers or industry analyses from consulting firms like McKinsey said that Decentralized data annotation has the potential to reduce costs by 40-60% compared to traditional in-house methods.
* Increased Engagement: Blockchain ecosystems employing models like "Tag to Earn" have seen a 25-50% increase in on-chain transactions and user engagement.
* Yield Generation: On average, participants in similar models generate a 10-15% annual yield, with the potential for higher returns as the model scales.

This model not only aligns with the growing demand for high-quality AI data but also enhances blockchain activity and generates sustainable income, creating a win-win situation for all parties involved.
