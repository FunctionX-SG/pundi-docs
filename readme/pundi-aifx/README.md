# Pundi AIFX (data layer)

Pundi AIFX is a decentralized AI data processing layer that was formerly known as Function X (FX).&#x20;

As a data layer, it powers the Pundi AI suites of services by processing the transactions and smart contracts. Pundi AIFX is built using Cosmos SDK application with further modification including omnichain support of various EVM and Cosmos compatible blockchains.

It abstracts away (hide) the complexities of Pundi AI by allowing users to focus on the usage rather than the complex mechanism of achieving decentralizing.
